            # - Make a new letter:

        #/newletter (type /newletter to send a new letter) Example: #(line1) '/newletter'
        # Type the recipient's email on line number two Example: #(line2) 'email@email'
        # Type the subject on the third line Example: #(line3) 'Subject'
        # Type the message text on line number 4 and other lines of the message Example: #(line4) 'Mail body text'

        # So you need to set up 4 lines to send your new mail:

        #/newletter
        #email@email
        #my letter subject
        #my letter text

        # That is all.
        # ``````````````````````

            # - Check mail:

        #/mail - Check mail...
        # ``````````````````````
        
            # - Sending a reply:

        # Send a reply to a message on mail in a Discord channel - the email will be sent to the sender's mailbox @
        # ``````````````````````

            # - Software multi-mail bot description:

        # Add multiple accounts as you need, one per 1 text channel. Each text channel works like a mailbox for one account. Use another text channel for a second mail account, and set
        # channel IDs to configure it. Don't forget emojis to design your message folder style (Discord channel name setup, just copy and paste your favorite emoji into the text field)

        # Set up folders to receive letters from them

        # All new reader letters are marked as READ on your mail server and are not uploaded again to your channel

        # Send links or files as attachments

        # Set Interval in seconds to fetch your mailbox

        # You can set up music files from the archive to set notifications on new letters, just uncommit lines with sound definition to play them on terminal window or translate this sound to your other devices

        # /helpme - get help on chat

        # Important: if you read a letter in your mailbox and it is marked as read, it will be ignored by the bot and will not be delivered to the chat if this has not already happened

        # If you see an authentication problem, then you need to create access to other software and make a technical password on your mail provider in your account to allow access to this bot.
        # ``````````````````````

            # - Bot setup:

        # Add a new program to the Discord developer's account, authorize it on your Discord server

        # Set your new token to the script

        # Set up your mailboxes, folders to receive from them

        # Add a mail category to your server

        # Set up channels on your server and set IDs to the script; you can also set up your contacts' personal channels in the mail category

        # Run the Python script; as a result, you will see "Bot online," and you will see new mail on your channels

        # ``````````````````````
