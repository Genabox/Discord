            # - Make a new letter:

        #/newletter (type /newletter to send a new letter) Example: #(line1) '/newletter'
        # Type the recipient's email on line number two Example: #(line2) 'email@email'
        # Type the subject on the third line Example: #(line3) 'Subject'
        # Type the message text on line number 4 and other lines of the message Example: #(line4) 'Mail body text'

        # So you need to set up 4 lines to send your new mail:

        #/newletter
        #email@email
        #my letter subject
        #my letter text

        # That is all.

            # - Software multi-mail bot description:

        # Add multiple accounts as you need, one per 1 text channel. Each text channel works like a mailbox for one account. Use another text channel for a second mail account, and set
        # channel IDs to configure it. Don't forget emojis to design your message folder style (Discord channel name setup, just copy and paste your favorite emoji into the text field)

        # Set up folders to receive letters from them

        # All new reader letters are marked as READ on your mail server and are not uploaded again to your channel

        # Send links or files as attachments

        # Set Interval in seconds to fetch your mailbox

        # You can set up music files from the archive to set notifications on new letters

        # /helpme - get help on chat

        # If you see an authentication problem, then you need to create access to other software and make a technical password on your mail provider in your account to allow access to this bot.

            # - Bot setup:

        # Add a new program to the Discord developer's account, authorize it on your Discord server

        # Set your new token to the script

        # Set up your mailboxes, folders to receive from them

        # Add a mail category to your server

        # Set up channels on your server and set IDs to the script; you can also set up your contacts' personal channels in the mail category

        # Run the Python script; as a result, you will see "Bot online," and you will see new mail on your channels
